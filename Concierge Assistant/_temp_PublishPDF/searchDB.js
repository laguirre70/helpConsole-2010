The Concierge Assistant is a complex system that is very easy to use. To make it work the way you want it to there are several things you must setup before you begin to use it. Contact List Keywords These keywords are used to allow you to create the list of contacts that fit your guest's request. If he has asked about Thai Restaurants you can give him a list of the Thai Restaurants in your area. Event Types These types are used to group event entries. If your guest has asked about Boxing events you can give him a list of the Boxing Matches scheduled to occur in your coverage area. Logbook Categories These categories are used to group logbook entries. Think about how you want to analyze your entries before creating new categories. Do you want to see all restaurant reservations as a group and also be able to know how many reservations you have made for a particular restaurant? You have the ability to create a Vendor/Commission Report to list all restaurant reservations and sort by the restaurant name. Take a close look at your Data Entry Panels. These should not be changed once they have been defined. Any change, even a single character, means that the data on you pre-existing logbook entries may be lost . You may add additional line items, but please do not change the panels once your staff has begun to use them. Perhaps your General Manager asks you how many covers you booked for your property's gourmet restaurant last week. If you had included that restaurant as a logbook category you could run a report that will give you a list of all of the reservations booked during that time frame. Profile Indicators These indicators are used to store information about your most valued guests. You decide what types of information to retain. If your Marketing Department wants to run a special Anniversary promotion you will be able to give them a list of all Anniversaries by date, by state and city, or by name. Concierge Staff Members Each Concierge staff member has a Logon Name to use in accessing the Concierge Assistant. The initials you enter allow you to see who has added comments to the Logbook entries. You define who has access to the authorized features of the Concierge Assistant. Where is the old Tutorial?

An Internet browser is required for the network-hosted Concierge Web Page and Message Center features. Your email system must be MAPI compliant to take advantage of the software’s ability to email itineraries and confirmations. Connection to the Internet is not required nor is any additional software Workstation: Windows 95/98/NT/2000/XP 64mb memory (Minimum) 15mb free hard disk space (50mb for the Master Computer) Network Connectivity Server: Windows NT/2000/2003/XP Server or Novell Server Software 500mb free hard disk space recommended (for database folder and setup kit) Storage Requirements: When we initially download our application, (the software, the set-up data and the contact database (restaurants, churches, etc.)), it requires approximately 15mb of storage. We recommend having 500mb of space available to allow for growth and the efficient operation of our maintenance features. After operating for some time, a small to medium property will require from 50 to 100mb of storage. As a point of reference, a Las Vegas property has been using the system since May 2000, has 12 Concierges and, following our recommended maintenance procedures, their database is approximately 50mb. Installation Requirements: The only items needed from your IT department are the Network Path (Example: ??Servername?Apps?Concierge) for the installation, the property’s logo (see below), an IT contact name and his/her email address and telephone number. Once the Network Path is received at GKS, we will finalize the software application and databases for your use, and then upload it to our FTP site for your IT to download to your network. An email is sent to the IT contact with the simple instructions on how to install The Concierge Assistant. Logo Requirements: The best formats for the property logo are: 1.
