<p align="left"><span class="subheading">What do I need to get started?</span><br></p><p align="left">The Concierge Assistant is a complex system that is very easy to use. To make it
                        work the way you want it to there are several things you must setup before you begin
                        to use it.<br>
                        <font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b></b></font><br>
                            <span class="subheading">Contact List Keywords</span>&nbsp; <br></p><p align="left">These keywords are used
                            to allow you to create the list of contacts that fit your guest's request. If he
                            has asked about Thai Restaurants you can give him a list of the Thai Restaurants
                            in your area.<font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b></b></font></p><p align="left"><br><span class="subheading">Event Types</span><br></p><p align="left">These types are used to group event entries.
                                If your guest has asked about Boxing events you can give him a list of the Boxing
                                Matches scheduled to occur in your coverage area.<font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b></b></font></p><p align="left"><br>
                                    <span class="subheading">Logbook Categories</span></p><p align="left">These categories are used to group
                                    logbook entries. Think about how you want to analyze your entries before creating
                                    new categories. Do you want to see all restaurant reservations as a group and also
                                    be able to know how many reservations you have made for a particular restaurant?
                                    You have the ability to create a Vendor/Commission Report to list all restaurant
                                    reservations and sort by the restaurant name.<br>
                                    Take a <b>close</b> look at your Data Entry Panels. These should <b>not</b> be changed
                                    once they have been defined. Any change, even a single character, means that the
                                    data on you pre-existing logbook entries may be <b>lost</b>. You may add additional
                                    line items, but please do not change the panels once your staff has begun to use
                                    them.<br>
                                    Perhaps your General Manager asks you how many covers you booked for your property's
                                    gourmet restaurant last week. If you had included that restaurant as a logbook category
                                    you could run a report that will give you a list of all of the reservations booked
                                    during that time frame.</p><p align="left"><span class="subheading">Profile Indicators&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><br></p><p align="left">These indicators are used to store
                                        information about your most valued guests. You decide what types of information
                                        to retain. If your Marketing Department wants to run a special Anniversary promotion
                                        you will be able to give them a list of all Anniversaries by date, by state and
                                        city, or by name.<font color="#ffffff" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="3"><b></b></font><br></p><span class="subheading">Concierge Staff Members&nbsp;</span>&nbsp; <br><br>Each Concierge staff member has
                                            a Logon Name to use in accessing the Concierge Assistant. The initials you enter
                                            allow you to see who has added comments to the Logbook entries. You define who has
                                            access to the authorized features of the Concierge Assistant.
