                        Print event listings for the week, or personalize for specific dates when a guest
                        will be in your location. Print, fax or email event schedules to a guest prior to
                        arrival, or have on hand and available to guests already on property.<br><br><br>

                        All Concierge Assistant Search Displays use the same, simple metaphor to access
                        your data. First, you <b>select</b> the information you wish to present. You can
                        key in any portion of the information you wish to select. For example: keying in
                        "George" in the Event Name selection will select all entries for events starring
                        George Carlin, George Clinton, George Jones, etc.

                                range of -7 to +21 days from the date the list is printed. If you have selected
                                event dates then these dates will be used on the list.</li><li>The Future Events list prints all events with starting dates more than 21 days from
