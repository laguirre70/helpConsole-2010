<P><FONT class=heading>Creating a New Logbook entry</FONT></P>
<P>The “Add” tab is used whenever a new guest request is entered into CA Web. <BR>Specific information is required whenever establishing a new logbook entry. The required information is indicated by a little red dot located to the immediate left of the data line as highlighted in the example below. Although there are no red dots associated with data entry fields within the “Guest Information” area, it goes without saying that the “Last Name” and “First Name” of the guest should be entered at all times. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image012.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN></P>
<P>All logbook entries require that the Reference Date, Time and Logbook Type fields in the "Entry" area of the screen be entered, as indicated by the red dots. After this information has been entered new information relevant to the specific logbook category will then fill the Entry area as shown in the example below for a Dining Reservation.</P></SPAN><IMG alt="" src="images/image013.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>When a field, such as Restaurant in this example, depends on Contact information contained within your existing database, CA Web provides an expedient solution to retrieving this information quickly and easily. </P>
<P>Enter 3 or 4 letters of the name of a known contact in the "Restaurant" line and click on the "Select Contact" button. </P></SPAN><IMG alt="" src="images/image014.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>This screen will appear. Double click on the requested contact, or highlight the contact and then click the OK button.</P></SPAN><IMG alt="" src="images/image015.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN>
<P>The Select Contacts button can be clicked without entering any information. This method is used to search out a contact based on other search criteria such as Keyword, Phone Number and City. This screen will appear with the full database. Here the user will enter the search criteria, such as "Restaurant" in the Keyword field and then click the Search button.</P></SPAN><IMG alt="" src="images/image016.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>When the correct vendor is located, double click directly on the name of the vendor or highlight the vendor and click on the OK button. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>When this is done, the selected contact will populate the proper fields within the logbook entry.</P></SPAN><IMG alt="" src="images/image017.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>The user at this time will fill out the remaining relevant fields. NOTE: All fields may not be necessary, such as Special Instructions or Notes. Leave these areas blank when not needed. </P>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>After the completion of the remaining fields, it is important to identify the Status of the logbook entry. The choices available to the users are in the drop down selection with the appropriate color coding, as in the example above. Be sure to click on the Save button when complete.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>After saving the entry, it will change in appearance.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>At the very top the name of the guest will appear in the new tab that has been created. Just under the tab, there is an ID number has that been assigned to the entry, the User Name of the creator of the logbook entry and the Entry Date.</P></SPAN><IMG alt="" src="images/image018.jpg?dummy=20100722134140"><BR><BR><SPAN lang=EN>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>The new screen gives you the opportunity to Change or Edit your Contact Selection. Follow the same steps used when selecting the Contact.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>In addition to the information entered, there are now additional tabs available to use by the staff. This section will be discussed in our Advanced Usage Best Practices publications.</P>
<P dir=ltr align=justify>If the user is making multiple reservations for the same guest or multiple reservations for the same type of reservation CA Web has fast, efficient shortcuts to streamline the workload.</SPAN><BR></P>
