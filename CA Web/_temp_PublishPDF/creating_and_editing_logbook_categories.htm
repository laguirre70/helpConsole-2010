<P><FONT class=heading>Creating and Editing Logbook Categories</FONT></P>
<P>In CA Web, Logbook Categories are used to track guests’ requests, whatever they may be! The property can create Logbook categories for any activity they wish to track i.e. Management can track their Manager’s Logs through logbook categories such as; Incident Reporting, Guest Complaints and/or Pre-Arrival calls. There is no limit to the types of Logbook Categories that can be created. <BR>To add a new category go to &gt;Administration&gt;Logbook Categories. Go to the Add area of the screen and enter the Name of your new Logbook Category and click on the Add button. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image004_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>After clicking the Add button, the new Logbook Category is added to the list of existing categories already in the database. The screen will also provide additional choices for your Logbook Category and the ability to construct your data entry panel. When editing simply click on the Logbook Category and follow the same procedures. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image005_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>In the data entry panel setup form, the Administrator is provided with a label for each line of information that is required to complete a request or service for the category being designed. As in the example below for Housekeeping Requests, the first label reflects the Type of Service being requested. The Requested Time of Service and the number of Days the service will be required. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image006_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>The field next to the Label is the Type of data or information that will be entered into this line when a user is filling out the request for the guest. There are multiple options depending on the type of information that will be required to be entered into this field, such as a date, a time, or a number. Simple text is most widely used for free form entry. <BR>Simply highlight the selection that best goes with the label. The box that is highlighted in this example is “Selection” and comes with a handy tool. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image007_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>The Selection option gives the Administrator a “pencil like” icon to the right, highlighted in blue in the above sample. When the Administrator clicks on the icon, a list of choices can be created by the Administrator that presents a “selection” of options to the user when entering the guest’s request in CA Web. Just enter each choice and click the Add button. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image008_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>The next field is the “Link this Contact Field”. This link is very important when you are dealing with logbook categoreis that will require contact information as part of the guest request such as Dining Reservations. (Refer to Best Practices Basic Logbook Usage) <BR>As you can see in this picture there is a drop down list of options on the kind of information you want to link to the contact information. The first label in the example below lists “Restaurant”. In that case you would want CA Web to link the “Contact Name” (highlighted below). For the Address label you would lnk “Address” from the drop down and so on. Many Logbook Categories won’t require this kind of linking but it is a real time saver for those that do. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image009_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>Continuing to the right, there is an ability to flag each line with a “Do Not Print”, if the Administrator does not want this information printed on the Guest Itinerary or Confirmation. A “Required Field” identifier is also provided in the event the Administrator needs to ensure this information be filled in with every entry made for this category. Simply enter a checkmark as in this example for either of these requirements. <BR>The last column provides the ability to expand on the number of data entry elements used for each category. Click on the plus (+) to add another line for more information or the minus (-) to remove a line of information. <BR>If it is necessary to change the order that the information is in, 2 arrows to the immediate left of the data entry element will either move the line up or move it down. Keep clicking the appropriate arrow until the element is in the proper location of the design. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image010_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>You may check on the design of the data entry panel at any time by clicking on the “Preview” button in the top right of the screen. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image011.gif?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>A preview of the way the data entry panel will appear to the user will become viewable, allowing the Administrator to make any changes before the Logbook Category becomes active. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image012_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>Other infiormation that will be valuable to Administrators is determining the Roles that have access to this logbook category. In the center of the example below is a listing of the Roles that have been created for this property. A checkmark in the box indicates that this Role has access to this logbook entry. No checkmark, no access. (Refer to our Best Practices Administration PCI <BR>Standards for Implementation and Credit Card Information for the discussion on Roles and Rights) <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image013_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>Some Logbook Categories may require a general disclosure of cancellation or other relevant information that can be provided to the guests on their Itineraries and Confirmations in order to avoid possible penalties or be aware of specific requirements for the activity. <BR>In CA Web we refer to this information as the “Confirmation Text” and it can be added to any category by simply clicking on the button located near all the other buttons at the top right of the screen. When selected a textbox will appear. The Administrator has the option of either entering a Vendor Text (appears on Vendor service form) or a Guest Text (appears on Guest Confirmation and Itinerary). <BR>Type the text in the main open body of the screen and click OK. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image014_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141">&nbsp;&nbsp; <IMG alt="" src="images/image015_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>The “Status Message” button gives the Administrator the ability to flag a Logbook Category with a message to the users for all entries made in this category. When this option is selected, this screen will appear. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image016_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>Select the dates you wish the message to appear from the drop down calendar. If the message is only to run for certain days in the week, such as only on Sundays, check the box next to “Select Days of Week”. Enter checkmarks into the applicable days of the week you want the message displayed to the user. If this box is left unchecked, CA Web will run the message every day of the week. <BR>Enter the message you want to appear when this logbook entry is initiated by a user in the “Message Text to Display” box and click Add. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image017_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>This will save the information and display the newly entered status message in the lower portion of the screen. The Administrator can now Edit or Delete the message by clicking on either of those words on the far right. In the meantime the upper screen is ready to go for the next message. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image018_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>When a logbook entry is made for this Logbook Category and the reference date entered is for any date within the date range outlined for the Status Message, it will appear to the user as displayed below. <BR><BR><IMG alt="" src="images/image019_1.jpg?dummy=20100722134141"><BR><BR>And last but not least………………………be sure to use the last little button on the right on the display screen and always remember to SAVE SAVE SAVE. <BR><BR><BR><FONT class=subheading color=#cbc9ba size=3 face=arial>See also</FONT></P>
